Game developed in Python using pygame as a homework for "Game and interactive simulation systems"

The icons are free to use and can be found at this address: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons

Special thanks to my girlfriend, Corina, who made the sprites (because I'm lazy to Photoshop) and tested the game.
She is also holding the highs-core with 120 points!
